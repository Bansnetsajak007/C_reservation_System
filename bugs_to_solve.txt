In the flight_name function, if the user_option is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, the function returns NULL, but this case is not handled in the flight_details function. It would be better to handle this case and display an appropriate message to the user.

The seat_details function simply returns the seat_no without performing any validation or checking for the maximum number of seats available. It's important to have proper bounds checking to ensure valid seat numbers and avoid accessing invalid memory.

The s_class function is unnecessary since it only returns the input parameter s_class as it is. You can directly use seat_class without the need for this function.

The reserve_ticket function does not check if the number of passengers has reached the maximum limit before adding a new passenger. This can lead to buffer overflow or other memory-related issues if the limit is exceeded.

In the cancel_reservation function, there is an unnecessary double check for the passenger name using strcmp. The condition if (strcmp(passengers[i].name, name) == 0) is checked twice, which is redundant.

There is no input validation or error handling for user inputs. For example, if the user enters an invalid option or provides incorrect data, the program may behave unexpectedly or crash.

The code lacks proper comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of various functions, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

The code could benefit from more modularization and separation of concerns. Breaking down the functionality into smaller functions would improve readability, reusability, and maintainability.

The use of global variables can make the code harder to understand and debug. It's generally better to limit the use of global variables and pass necessary data as function parameters.

The code does not handle cases where the user enters a name that matches multiple passengers. It will cancel the reservation for the first matching name found, which may not be the intended behavior.

The code does not handle cases where the user enters a name that does not exist in the passenger list. It should provide appropriate feedback to the user in such cases.

The scanf function is used without specifying the field width for string inputs, which can lead to buffer overflow if the input exceeds the buffer size. It's recommended to use fgets or specify the maximum length in scanf to avoid this issue.
